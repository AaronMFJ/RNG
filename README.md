Creating a random number generator using windows forms for practice

Following this tutorial: http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/application_visual_studio_2013.php

ALl of my projects so far have been made and used with commandlines. I wanted to understand how to create a UI with 
Windows Forms. Keep in mind that a lot of the code is generated by adding buttons, so it's not always very clear why
or how something is happening but you can get a general idea by reading through it. I've added comments on everything
I add which should help to describe what is happening with code you manually have to write/add/edit.

Let me know if you have any questions -- this is a work in progress.
